# Weighted-Grade-Computation-and-Goodreads-Dataset-Cleaning-in-Python
Completed lab project demonstrating matrix operations with NumPy to calculate student grades and data cleaning with Pandas on a Goodreads dataset, highlighting understanding of machine learning concepts as well as core skills in linear algebra, data preparation, and exploratory analysis.

**Purpose**

This project was completed as part of my Machine Learning Foundations course in Purdue University’s Cybersecurity Workforce Certification Training program. It builds upon earlier work with matrix operations by applying them to compute student final grades, while also introducing real-world data cleaning using a Goodreads dataset.

This project deepened my understanding of:

* Applying matrix multiplication to weighted grade calculations

* Normalizing datasets to a common scale

* Cleaning messy datasets (handling NaNs, invalid values, and type conversions)

* Using Pandas for aggregation and exploratory analysis

**Project Structure**

Machine Learning Foundations - Lab 2 Final Code File.ipynb: Colab Notebook containing all code, explanations, and results

lab2-hw.txt, lab2-test.txt, lab2-quiz.txt, lab2-project.txt: Student grade text files

lab2-T2-data.pkl: Goodreads dataset

**Tasks Completed**

✅ **Part One: Matrix Grade Computation**

Step 1: Load student grade data from text files

Step 2: Convert Strings to Floats

Step 3: Compute Averages for Each Category

Step 4: Normalize Scores to a 100-Point Scale

Step 5: Build the Grade Matrix

Step 6: Define the Weight Vector

Step 7: Apply Matrix Multiplication

Bonus: Build a Final Grades Table

✅ **Part Two: Goodreads Data Cleaning and Analysis**

Step 1: Load the Dataset

Step 2: Explore the Data

Step 3: Check for Missing Values

Step 4: Drop Rows Missing Critical Fields

Step 5: Missing Non-Critical Fields (Replace NaNs with blank strings)

Step 6: Remove Invalid Records

Step 7: Group Data by Author

Step 8: Display Books by Most Prolific Author
